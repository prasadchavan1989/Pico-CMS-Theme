The world is full of people who can code a solution in 5+ different languages. Even I can code them, but probably in 2. Of course, it is a good thing that we all (developers) can understand requirements and develop logic that can be used to deploy a solution. But the technology keeps changing year after year. Even before you can completely master a programming space, there are dozens of updates that start to lure around the corner and you feel like a diminishing star in a huge galaxy. 

I too am going through the same situation. The IT sector has hundred's of thousand of Java/PHP developers like me. So where do I stand in comparison to them ? I am just one of them, one from the CROWD. What good does that mean to me, or anyone else who is in the same boat as me ? I always dreamed to be different, someone who has his own identity and not from the CROWD. What about you ?
