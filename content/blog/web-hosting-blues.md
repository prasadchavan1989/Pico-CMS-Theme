Description: This post is about my transition of web hosting from Speedhost.in to OBizTek.com

I am just a casual blogger who writes a blog post once in a blue moon. Till now I was using [Speedhost.in](http://www.speedhost.in) web hosting which costed around **Rs 1200/year**. It was good, definitely, but I was running short of funds and so I was searching for something that is cheap & reliable too. It was a very hard decision to switch from [*SpeedHost.in*](http://www.speedhost.in) to [*OBizTek.com*](http://www.obiztek.com). I still have my domain hosted with them.

I have settled for a very basic plan, which serves me right at this point of time. Following are the details :

* 100MB Disk Space
* 1GB Bandwidth/Month
* 1 Domain
* 1 Sub-Domain
* 1 Database
* 20 Email Ids
* Cpanel

And all this at just **Rs 400/year**.

This is my first post on the new hosting service. I hope it turns out a good deal for me.
