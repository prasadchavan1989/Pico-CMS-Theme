Installed [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/), finally. I created my account on GitHub around a year back, but that was just out of curiosity. I never did anything after that. Today, I read an article on version control and that motivated me to start using GitHub.

GitHub is a code sharing and publishing service. In other words, it is a social networking site for programmer's. At the heart of GitHub is Git: a distributed version control and source code management (SCM) system. Git is command line tool whereas GitHub is a web based graphical tool. 

GitHub for Windows is a native windows app that brings all the functionality of Git command line tool to a nicely built GUI. Using GitHub is very simple. I referred to [this](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/github-tutorial) article for setting up the app and creating my first [repository](https://github.com/prasadchavan1989/Pico-Theme).

I think GitHub is cool and every developer should start using it, just like i did.
