From the day I learnt about *Responsive Design* in web designing, I was hooked to [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) CSS framework. I have been using it for quite a long time. *Skeleton* framework is clean & easy to understand. It is implemented using the 960 grid system, which is good for most of the responsive projects, but it is not good enough if you plan to utilize the full canvas area of a web page. Being a 960 grid framework means it doesn't scale above that limit and then you start to realize something is missing from this framework. I faced the same problem. At that point of time I switched to [Pure](http://purecss.io), a CSS framework from Yahoo! team.

*Pure* framework is fluid based, has more addons like forms, buttons, tables & menus, that too are essential when you are doing more than just a project. You can even customize the grid layout provided by Pure framework to suit your coding style and have it downloaded. I haven't mastered *Pure* yet, but surely it will be under my belt in the days to come.
